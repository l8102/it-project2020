## General info
This project is to generate an online e-portfolio system for students to upload their work and for teachers to browse students work. We want this project to be a showcase of the efforts made by students over their university career and for them to use on their resume.

## Technologies
Project is created with:
* Mongo Database
* Express
* React
* Node
* Heroku

## Accessing the Project
The project can be accessed at: https://eaglesolutions.herokuapp.com


## Running the Project locally

To run the project locally you will have to manually change the BASE_URL in Api.js located in 'frontend/src/' on line 6 so that localHost is the BASE_URL

When that is confirmed you can run the program using the command: 'npm run dev' from the root folder (Where this README.md file is)
